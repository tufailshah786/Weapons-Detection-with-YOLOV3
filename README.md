# Weapons Detection with YOLOV3
Weapons Detection in very important task in surveillance system to improve the security and safty of the mankind. Nodoubt, its very difficult and effortful task in terms of size, shape and different colors of weapons as well as the inconsistent backgrounds. There are different object detection algorithms are available that are used for the number of different applications some of them are given below:<br/>
- Face Detection
- Pedestrian Detection
- Skeleton Detection<br/>

We implement the state of the art algorithm YOLOV3 for the detection of weapons.<br/>
